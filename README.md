Design Patterns
We used good design patterns to build this website, including:

- Component-based architecture: We used React's component-based architecture to create reusable UI components, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
- CSS Modules: We used CSS Modules to scope CSS styles to individual components, avoiding conflicts and making it easier to manage styles.
- Responsive design: We designed the website to be responsive, using media queries and flexible layout techniques to ensure that the website looks good on different devices and screen sizes.
